# CS 361 - Final Project
By Carly Coccaro

## About
This final project for CS 361 is called The Receipe Box. It's a console application that scrapes recipe data from websites and returns it to the user.
The application is written in Golang and contains a Python microservice written by my partner, James Cohrs.

## Communication Contract
I have developed a microservice for my partners project. This microservice will be added directly to his console application. 

This microservice connects to his program via a socket connection.
